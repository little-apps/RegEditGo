# RegEditGo
Navigates to a Windows Registry key and (possibly) a value name in regedit.exe. Instead of just setting ``LastKey`` in ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Regedit``, this utilizes Windows Message to navigate like an actual user would. This project is a fork of [JumpTo RegEdit](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/20283/jumpto-regedit) created by Reto Ravasio in August 2007.
